Happa Interface Prototype
-------------------------

This is Giant Swarm's interface prototype / experiment. It is meant to help us
get feedback on the types of complex interactions we are going to make and how
best to implement them.


Getting started
---------------

Requirements: docker

You should be able to start the development server with:

`make develop`

Then visit `docker.dev:8000/webpack-dev-server/`

Any changes should cause the browser to reload automatically

Running tests
-------------

`make test`

No tests at the moment though
